Ex-Facebook/Meta where I built:
- Distributed Secondary Graph Indexing Solution for TAO - Meta's Social Graph
- Performance and Efficiency tools and automation for managing compute and storage for the Social Graph Stack
- ML enabled Adaptivity for GraphQL to balance app performance and compute cost tackling prefetching, on device caching and parameter optimization
- Meta's Privacy Infrastructure stack to annotate and track data flows at scale
- Meta's automated tooling to continuously verify data use statements
